# RealEstateDatabaseWarehouseProject
For my university project, I developed a Real Estate Database Warehouse using MySQL. It featured an ER diagram and tables for properties, owners, tenants, agents, contracts, payments, and maintenance requests. Complex queries, triggers, and stored procedures ensured efficient data management and analysis.
